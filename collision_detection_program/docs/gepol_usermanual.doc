*** Aim

       This program calculates the envelop surface for a molecule, as a
       points distribution, and computes its  correspondent area and volume.
       As data the coordinates of atoms, the radii assigned to them and
       the solvent radius (Probe radius) are needed.
       
       It calculates the three kind of envelop surfaces:

         - THE VAN DER WAALS MOLECULAR SURFACE. It is the surface 
       resulting from a set of intersecting spheres with radii of van
       der Waals, centred on selected nuclei of the molecule (Figure 1).

         - THE ACCESSIBLE MOLECULAR SURFACE. It was defined by
       B.Lee and F.M.Richards (J.MOL.BIOL.55(1971)379-400. It is the
       surface defined by the center of the solvent sphere (probe sphere)
       when it rolls around the van der waals surface. This program
       calculate this surface adding the probe radius to every radius
       atom (Figure 2).

         - THE MOLECULAR SURFACE. It was defined by F.M.Richards 
       (Ann. Rev. Biophys. Bioeng.,6 (1977)151-176).This surface is
       composed of two parts: THE CONTACT SURFACE and THE REENTRANT
       SURFACE. He defines the contact surface to be that part of
       the van der waals surface of each atom which is accessible 
       to a probe sphere of a given radius. Also the reentrant
       surface is define as the inward-facing part of the probe sphere 
       when it is simultaneously in contact with more than one atom
       (see figure 3).The present program calculates the Molecular 
       Surface creating a set of new spheres locating among the original
       spheres defined at the input geomtry. At this proces we call 
       'smoothing' of the surface.
 
       


       
*** Computacional especifications

       This program is written in FORTRAN 77 and runed over VAX VMS.
              
*** Input
       
       File    FOR005

       The input is composed of the next records:
     -- 1st record.-- Format (80A1)
            
            Title

  
     -- 2nd record.-- Format(4(3A,1X))
         
         It is composed of four character variables. The options
         must be written with capital letters.
      
         Variable         Options
     
         SUAVE             CON   Smoothing.
                           SIN   No smoothing.

         VECTOR            VES   Print the points and the corresponding vectors
                                 on the surface.
                           VEN   No print.
           
         SUMA              SUM   Adding the probe radius plus the van der
                                 Waals radi of atoms.
                           NSU   No adding.

         OPESF             SFY   Print information about spheres.
                           SFN   No print.

         If the van der Waals surface is requerided, SUAVE will be
         SIN and SUMA will be NSU.
         If you want the accesible surface, SUAVE=SIN and SUMA=SUM
         If you want the molecular surface, SUAVE=CON and SUMA=NSU

         Variable
           
           NDIV     It specifies the division level for the triangles on the
                    surface. Each of the spheres is divided in 60 
                    triangles if NDIV=1. If NDIV=2 in 240 triangles.
                    If NDIV=3 in 960, if NDIV=4 in 3840 and if NDIV=
                    5 in 15360 triangles. 
                    The accuracy improve when NDIV raise.
                    The cpu time  increase with NDIV.
                    We think that NDIV equal to 3 is a good value (reference B
                    is concerned with study about this point).

           RD       It is the probe radious.
                    It is only necessary if SUAVE=CON or SUMA=SUM.
           
           FRADIO   This parameter controls the new spheres creation
                    (smoothing).One may introduced values in the range from
                    0.0 to 1.0. It is only need if SUAVE=CON.
                    The accuracy improves when the FRADIO value decreases.
                    We recomend values are about 0.55 (see reference C)
                    Really the program controls the smoothing with the 
                    next three parameters (see reference A): OMEGA,FRO 
                    and RET. The value of OMEGA is assigned into the 
                    program as a DATA Fortran sentence. At this version
                    OMEGA=50.0. To FRO the program  assignes the same value 
                    that FRADIO (at reference A FRO is F). The program gives
                    to RET (at reference A RET is the Minimal Radious)
                    the value resulting by multiply FRADIO by RAT.
                    RAT is the average of the all atoms radii given at 
                    INPUT.
